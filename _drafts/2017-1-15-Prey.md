It doesn't happen very often but every once and awhile one of our laptops will go missing. I don't worry about data getting into the wrong hands because FileVault 2 has my back. It would be nice to get our hardware back.

We do make an attempt to recover the hardware with an application called [prey](https://www.preyproject.com). Prey is a hardware tracking tool. They have several levels of service but for my use case I go with the free tier. Prey works by installing what some would call a hacked up set of bash scripts. That maybe be true but it works when I need it and for me that's all that counts (github link to code).

I don't install Prey on every Mac in the fleet. I only install it when one goes missing. The package and pkinfo in all set in Munki. I just need to assign the name to the manifest.
